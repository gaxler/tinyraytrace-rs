Following the [tinyraytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki/Part-1:-understandable-raytracing) tutorial in Rust


### So what's the plan?
  1. We'll recreate the tiny ray tracer in Rust
  2. Optimize & Benchmark scene rendering
  3. See what [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) can do to speed this up on a CPU
  4. Try to do something funny, call [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) from Rust and see if we can do the rendering on GPU/TPU that way.
