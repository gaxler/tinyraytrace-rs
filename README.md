# Tiny Ray Tracer - Rust

 [![Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/yt2mp3/badge/?version=latest)](https://gaxler.github.io/tinyraytrace-rs/tinyraytracer/)

## What is it?
Learning about Ray Tracing by build a basic Ray Tracer. Following [Understandable RayTracing in 256 lines of bare C++](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki) but doing it in Rust.


## Where we at?
This is our current progress vs. where we are heading:

</p>


## So what's the plan?
  1. We'll recreate the tiny ray tracer in Rust
  2. Optimize & Benchmark scene rendering
  3. See what [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) can do to speed this up on a CPU
  4. Try to do something funny, call [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) from Rust and see if we can do the rendering on GPU/TPU that way.
